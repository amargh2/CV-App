This is a very simple app that takes input, stores it in state as necessary, and that state is passed to various children as props.
The experience section renders as a list, and information publishes to the DOM in real time. To expand this, I would like to add more fields
for specific inputs, like University, Company, Years, etc, and have it really put out a well formatted document. But for now
I am moving on, since this project was mainly about learning state management and props.
